# Lung Disease Detection using Deep Learning 

This project is part of a research proposal aiming to develop an AI-based system for detecting pulmonary diseases from chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques.

## 🔍 Goal

To design and implement a lightweight yet accurate convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can detect multiple thoracic diseases using chest radiographs, especially under low-data conditions (few-shot learning).

## 📂  Structure

- `notebooks/`: Exploratory data analysis and training notebooks.
- `src/`: Python scripts for training, evaluation, and utility functions.
- `data/`: Sample images or links to public datasets.
- `models/`: Saved model weights or architectures.
- `reports/`: Output metrics, charts, and evaluation results.

## 🛠 Technologies

- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset

We use publicly available datasets such as:

- [CheXpert](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/)

## ✍️ Context

This project is aligned with a research proposal titled:  
**"Few-shot Learning for Automated Chest Disease Diagnosis using Teacher-Student Frameworks"**

The goals include:
- Reducing data dependency for rare disease detection  
- Improving generalization with meta-learning  
- Creating interpretable AI solutions in radiology
